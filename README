== ActsAsCacheable

Adds capability for caching query results to any ActiveRecord object.
Cached query results are stored as marshalled objects on the file system.
This differs from ActiveRecord query cache in that these results are available
across the entire application, and not just within the scope of a single action.

== Example


   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
     acts_as_cacheable :cache_path => "/tmp/cache/queries",
       :queries => {
         :all_books => [:all, {:order => "created_on"}],
         :banned_books => [:all, {
           :select => "author, title",
           :conditions => "status = 'banned'",
           :order => "title" }
   end

   class BooksController < ApplicationController
     cache_sweeper :book_sweeper, :only => [:create, :update, :destroy]

     def list_all_books
       @books = Book.all_books
     end

     def list_banned_books
       @books = Book.banned_books
     end
   end

   class BookSweeper < ActionController::Caching::Sweeper
     observe Book

     def after_create(book)
       Book.clear_cache
     end

     def after_update(book)
       Book.clear_cache
     end

     def after_destroy(book)
       Book.clear_cache
     end
   end
